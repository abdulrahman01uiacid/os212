### Berikut beberapa link yang saya sarankan
1. [**Creating a GitHub Pages site**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site)<br>
   For friends who have difficulty creating GitHub pages, maybe you can visit the official documentation from GitHub itself regarding the creation of GitHub Pages.

## WEEK 02
2. [**Learn C Language (in bahasa)**](https://www.petanikode.com/c-linux/)<br>
   For those of you who don't know what C language is, maybe you can take a look at this article. In general, the syntax of the C language is similar to the C++ language because the C++ language is actually built from the C language itself with additions. This article also teaches about how to run a C program.

3. [**C Language Basic Structure and Related Rules C Language Syntax**](https://www.petanikode.com/c-syntak/)<br>
   In general, the syntax of the C language is similar to that of C++ or Java. Like every syntax ends with a semicolon (;) and each block is delimited by curly braces ("{}"). In addition, unlike Java, which is based on OOP, the C language is Function-based where each program will have one main function, the main() function. At the end of this article there are also links to other C language materials that may be useful for friends.

## WEEK 03
4. [**grep command in Unix/Linux**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/)<br>
   grep command is one of the most commonly used commands on linux. In general, the purpose of grep is to search in a file for data that matches a given pattern. If friends are interested in learning it, maybe you can visit this article. However, you can also simply type 'grep --help' in the CLI to get a brief explanation of grep.

5. [**Getting to Know the Basic Grep Commands on GNU/Linux**](https://www.linuxsec.org/2016/10/basic-grep-command.html)<br>
   Similar to the article above, it may only be written in Indonesian. Maybe it can be a solution if friends are a little less familiar with English.

## WEEK 04
6. [**How to remove incorrect password for file symmetrically encrypted with GPG**](https://superuser.com/questions/1097230/how-to-remove-incorrect-password-for-file-symmetrically-encrypted-with-gpg)<br>
   If you have entered the wrong password while working on this W04 task, you may not be able to re-enter the password for a while. This is similar to what I experienced, to solve this, I tried to find a related answer in this problem. As a result, I can re-enter the password with a valid password.

7. [**Interactive Learning C Bahasa**](https://www.learn-c.org/)<br>
   The website provides how many kinds of materials are used to learn C language. In addition to the material, this website also provides exercises to make us more understanding. Actually, this is what I have always needed, to be able to learn interactive C language. Thank you [Andhira Henrisen Sikoko](https://andhi30.github.io/os212/) for sharing a very useful link, especially for me personally.

## WEEK 05
8. [**Learn about memory replacement (in bahsan)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCky3aQMaPA&list=PL21TusoIkLo8nLC2wdibOhhYwrdXWnulT)<br>
   This week we are studying about memory. One of the topics discussed is dealing with Page Faults. In general, page faults arise due to the need for physical memory (eg RAM) for a page but the page is not in the frame of memory at that time. There are several algorithms used to do this. For example First In Frist Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU) and Optimal Page Replacement. The link I shared [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCky3aQMaPA&list=PL21TusoIkLo8nLC2wdibOhhYwrdXWnulT) is a playlist that can help all of you to understand these three algorithms. In addition, the discussion in the video is in Indonesian and is very easy to understand.

9. [**FIFO VS OPTIMAL VS LRU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHu-8IQ97AQ&list=PL21TusoIkLo8nLC2wdibOhhYwrdXWnulT&index=6)<br>
   In this video, we discuss the comparison between the three algorithms that I mentioned earlier. Actually, this video has also been listed in the playlist that I provided above, but so that friends who may already understand but want to know the difference or which one is better to use, can immediately get what they need without having to search again. Hopefully it can be useful, this discussion could be included in the discussion of next week's quiz :D.

## WEEK 06
10. [**Learn Fork() part 1**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwxTbksJ2fo)<br>
    This video explains how the fork() function is executed. If you still don't understand how fork() works, this video might help.

11. [**Learn Fork() part 2**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kUiH8DG-Ao)<br>
    This video is a continuation of the video above. This video describes calling the fork() function associated with the PID (process ID) when executing the fork() function.

12. [**Fork() Vs. Exec()**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFEFVXvjiHY)<br>
    This video is a video from the Neso Academy channel. This video explains the difference between the fork() function and the exec() function. In general, these two functions are similar in that they both create a new process. The difference is that fork() will continue to run its parent, while exec() will overwrite the existing process. Sorry if my explanation is not quite right :D, maybe for clarity, friends, you can watch this video.

## WEEK 07
13. [**Introduction to Threads**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOfGJcVnvAk)<br>
    This week we learn about threads. At first glance, these threads are similar to the week06 material, namely dealing with forks. Both of these materials discuss the same thing, namely the concurrent process. The video above is quite clear about threads and the reasons and benefits of using threads in the Operating System. As a suggestion, if you feel the video is too slow, maybe x1.5 speed is enough to overcome it, but if it's still not enough, maybe you can speed it up again but it might be difficult to understand the explanation :D.

14. [**Process Management (Processes and Threads)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrM7nZcxXZU)<br>
    This video explains about process management in operating systems. In addition, this video also explains how to find out what processes are running on our computer along with therads (Windows). Just like the previous video, maybe the speed can be increased by x1.5 so it doesn't take too long :D.

15. [**Programming with Threads | Jacob Sorber**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uA8X5zNOGw8&list=PL9IEJIKnBJjFZxuqyJ9JqVYmuFZHr7CFM)<br>
    This link is a playlist containing an explanation video on threads on C Programing. The videos presented are quite short, meaning that each video has a fairly short duration but has a fairly comprehensive discussion regarding the topics discussed.

## WEEK 08
16.  [**Neso Academey | CPU Scheduling**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWkQl0n0w5M&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRitWSE_AyyySWfhRgyA-rHk)<br>
    This link contains a playlist created by Chanel Neso Acdemy about CPU scheduling in the operating system. Maybe this playalist can be useful for friends to understand material related to cpu scheduling and can be used as material for quiz preparations

17. [**Kemotex | LFS Book Ch05 : Compiling a Cross-Toolchain - LFS 11.0 on iMac ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVKFOJQOFWE&list=PLyc5xVO2uDsDK5_zewRXYOZA0cyjwcboE&index=8)<br>
    This link contains a playlist about installing LFS (Linux From Scratch). Specifically, this link will refer to playlist number 8 to be precise regarding Chapter 5 of the LFS book which is related to "Compiling a Cross-Toolchain". This video really helped me to complete assignments W08 #05. Especially to avoid errors when installing and compiling.
